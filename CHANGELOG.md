## [1.2.0](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-core.php/tree/1.2.0) (2018-08-23)

### Changed

* The client used to create a log entry with a full message by default. Now it will create one regular entry with either level "INFO" or "ERROR" depending on the status code of the response, and one with level "DEBUG" with full dumps of request, response, and exception. 

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-core.php/tree/1.1.0) (2018-06-06)

### Fixed

* `Contentful\Core\Api\Location` used to provide a wrongful serialization of the longitude property. Now it correctly serializes to `lon` instead of `long`.

### Changed
* The `Contentful\Core\Log\Timer` has been deprecated and will be removed in version 2.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-core.php/tree/1.0.0) (2018-04-17)

### Added
